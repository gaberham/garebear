# Permit Crawler
Application used to crawl recreation.gov permit availability webpages and alert when specified permits are available during desired time periods.

## Working branch
[Parser](https://github.com/talfers/garebear/tree/parser)

## Current updates
Adding methods in [parser.py](https://github.com/talfers/garebear/blob/main/classes/parser.py) to parse availability data structures.

## Run application
Currently the application is run using:
```shell
python app.py

But we will soon create Makefiles and the ability to run more easily.
